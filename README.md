Hi, Iâ€™m a 17y computer science student from finland.

I've interests in game making, automatisation, porting and working with low level hardware/frameworks.
I've been learning c++/c and python for about a year now, and almost nothing to show for it.

**The easiest** way to reach me is through Discord: Giffi#8427.
